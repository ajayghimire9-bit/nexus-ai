# NEXUS progress log

Status is architecture plus measured local experiments. Completing a version tag is not AGI, not a profitable trading system, and not learned meta-RL unless that claim is supported below.

## V0.4 (retained)

Measured 2026-10-11, CPU. Prior CartPole / Acrobot PPO and evolution numbers are **not overwritten**.

| Run | Setup | Timesteps | Eval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PPO CartPole seed 1 | separate trunks, 10 epochs | 249 856 | **500.0** vs random 22.4 |
| PPO CartPole seed 2 | same | 249 856 | **409.5** vs random 26.2 (**not solved**) |
| PPO CartPole seed 2 (retrain) | same recipe | **399 872** | **500.0** vs random 26.3 |
| PPO CartPole seed 3 | same | 249 856 | **500.0** vs random 21.5 |
| Multi-seed @ 250k | seeds 1,2,3 | 249 856 | mean **469.8**, std 42.7 |
| PPO Acrobot | separate agent | 249 856 | **−83.25** vs random −500 |
| CartPole evolution | 49 152 / candidate | 49 152 | all gen-1 candidates **500** (ceiling) |
| Acrobot evolution | 81 920 / candidate | 81 920 | best **−75.2** (tanh 64-64, gen 1) |

## V0.5 (this increment)

### Tests

`pytest` **41 passed** in **1.03s** (Python 3.13.5, pytest 9.1.1). No tests skipped.

### PPO / GAE (Stage 1)

Dummy next-step autoreset transitions are masked out of policy, value, and entropy losses (regression: poisoning dummy returns no longer explodes value loss). Same-step autoreset no longer treats the following step as a dummy. Discrete eval is deterministic-argmax and repeatable; continuous greedy action is the distribution mean.

**Not measured:** a 250k CartPole retrain after these loss-masking changes. Do not claim PPO sample-efficiency improved vs V0.4.

### Meta-controller (Stages 2–5)

Seven validated actions (mutate, crossover, expr-mutate, LR search, width search, extra eval, architecture transfer). No `exec` of generated Python.

Controllers: random, ε-greedy (heuristic, **not** meta-RL), disjoint **LinUCB** (contextual bandit, **not** meta-RL). LinUCB updates `A`, `b` from the controller reward.

Controller reward is task-normalized vs a random-policy baseline on the **same** env, plus sample-efficiency / complexity / time / failure terms. Holdout eval seed feeds the controller; `assessment_eval_seed` is reserved for extra evaluation so the selector cannot freely reuse one test set as its only score.

Loop: OBSERVE → PROPOSE → VALIDATE → TRAIN → EVALUATE → STORE → UPDATE → stop on frozen `max_experiments` / `max_timesteps`. Duplicate fingerprints are skipped. Controller state JSON is persisted. Champion checkpoints are copied, not deleted.

The controller cannot change resource caps, eval seeds, or permissions.

### Equal-budget smoke comparison (Stage 7)

Budget frozen at **2 experiments**, **512 env-steps cap**, **256 train steps** per train action, **1 train seed**, **2 eval episodes**. This is a protocol check, not a ranking study.

| Controller | n experiments | n fail | mean controller reward | best task-normalized score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| random | 2 | 0 | 0.085 | CartPole 0.236; Acrobot 0.185 |
| ε-greedy | 1 | 1 | 0.046 | CartPole 0.148 |
| LinUCB | 2 | 0 | −0.017 | CartPole 0.034 |

**LinUCB is not superior on this budget.** ε-greedy recorded a failure/skip (likely extra-eval with no champion or a duplicate fingerprint). Scores are tiny-budget PPO returns, far from CartPole-solved. Robustness across many controller seeds and a held-out experimental condition set was **not** run.

### Activation expressions (Stage 6)

Restricted trees (approved torch ops only), population + mutate/crossover, node cap 12, SHA canonical dedup, learnable affine `(scale, shift)`, numerical validation. Training eval of expr search at V0.3/V0.4 activation-screen scale was **not re-run** in this increment beyond unit tests.

### Incomplete

- No 250k PPO confirmation after dummy-loss masking.
- No large equal-budget controller study; no multi-seed controller robustness.
- Extra-evaluation of a missing champion is a failed experiment.
- Architecture transfer in the loop uses matched seeds but still a tiny train budget.
- NEXUS Alpha / live trading: not implemented.
- The agent cannot alter its own safety, eval, or financial-risk rules.
